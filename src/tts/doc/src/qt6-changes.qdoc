    \title Changes to Qt TextToSpeech

    \brief Migrate Qt TextToSpeech to Qt 6.

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.

    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.

    In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt TextToSpeech, and provide
    guidance to handle them.

    \section1 Available Engines

    All engines that were available in Qt 5 are also available in Qt 6.4. For a
    complete list of available engines in Qt 6.4, see \l{Qt TextToSpeech Engines}.

    Engines can now receive additional configuration parameters. When constructing
    a QTextToSpeech instance, pass a QVariantMap with engine-specific key/value
    pairs.

    \section1 API changes

    The Qt TextToSpeech module has undergone some basic consolidation and
    cleanup. There should be minimal porting effort to be able to switch to Qt6.

    \section2 The QTextToSpeech class

    The new \l{QTextToSpeech::}{engine} property allows changing of the engine on an
    initialized QTextToSpeech object.

    \section2 The QVoice class

    Existing code using the QVoice class continues to work as before. QVoice objects
    can now be serialized via QDataStream.

    \section2 The QTextToSpeechEngine and QTextToSpeechPlugin classes

    These classes have been removed from the public API. They still exist and are
    used by the available engine implementations, but they are not part of the
    documented and supported API, and are likely to change in future releases.
